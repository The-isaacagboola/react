To implement the functions that modify the data as requested, here are some potential solutions:

### 1. Add 1 to the score of a clicked comment:

```typescript
function upvoteComment(id: number): void {
  const updatedData = data.comments.map((comment) =>
    comment.id === id ? { ...comment, score: comment.score + 1 } : comment,
  );
  setData({ ...data, comments: updatedData });
}
```

### 2. Remove 1 from the score of a specified comment:

```typescript
function downvoteComment(id: number): void {
  const updatedData = data.comments.map((comment) =>
    comment.id === id && comment.score > 0
      ? { ...comment, score: comment.score - 1 }
      : comment,
  );
  setData({ ...data, comments: updatedData });
}
```

### 3. Delete a comment from the data:

```typescript
function deleteComment(id: number): void {
  const updatedData = data.comments.filter((comment) => comment.id !== id);
  setData({ ...data, comments: updatedData });
}
```

### 4. Edit a specified comment:

```typescript
function editComment(id: number, newContent: string): void {
  const updatedData = data.comments.map((comment) =>
    comment.id === id ? { ...comment, content: newContent } : comment,
  );
  setData({ ...data, comments: updatedData });
}
```

### Explanation:

- **upvoteComment**: Increases the score of a comment by finding it by ID and incrementing the `score` by 1.
- **downvoteComment**: Decreases the score of a comment by finding it by ID and decrementing the `score` by 1, ensuring that the score doesn't go below 0.
- **deleteComment**: Removes a comment from the `comments` array by filtering out the comment with the given ID.
- **editComment**: Updates the content of a comment by finding it by ID and replacing its `content` with the provided `newContent`.

After making changes, `setData` is called to update the state with the modified data.
